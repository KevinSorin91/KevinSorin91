I've done a project using Hardhat,

Followed Buildspace course to mint my own NFT collection using a Web3 app.

Used Solidity, JS, React.
https://replit.com/@KevinSorin91 to check-out the project.

https://diarrheenft.kevinsorin91.repl.co/ is the final product.


Currently learning 3D game development using Unity.

There will be some Unity Projects soon in my repos.
